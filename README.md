# Pandora (BETA)

**Export Maltego Graphs to JSON format**

This means you can import them into Splunk, ElasticSearch or anything else that accepts JSON.

## Command Line Export

To run a simple export you can use the command line as below:

```
./pandora ExampleGraph.mtgx
```

This will save the new json file to `output/ExampleGraph.json`.

## Web Interface

You can also use the web interface to export and view the output. To start the web server just run:

```
./webserver.py
```

This will start a small Flask web server on port 5000.

This is just the beginning of the project so more updates will come.
